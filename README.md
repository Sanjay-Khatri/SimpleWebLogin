SimpleWebLogin is the easiest demonstration of how to create a registration form along with the login process. The project is using sqlite for database. 

Using Apache Tomcat 8.5 and Java 1.8

-----Database Directory------
There is database include in the project at /db/student.db which has following username and password:

username			password

hello				hello@12
success				success@12

Initially the database has been created at the path  "D:/student.db" you can change manually before running the project. The project also check validation like whether the field is empty, password and confirm password are same before saving information in the databases. Also it show errors if occur any on browser.
